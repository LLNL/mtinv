### Introduction

The MTINV toolkit (2002-present) is a collection of computer codes and applications written to invert for the moment tensor of a seismic source given the three components of ground motion recorded at regional seismic stations (e.g., Ichinose et al., 2003). The computer codes and workflow are organized to generate moment tensor solutions for a range of source depths and origin times because of the trade-off between these two quantities. The metric used is the variance reduction and variance reduction modulated by the percent double-couple to determine the best-fit moment-tensor solution. We can solve for a deviatoric moment tensor with a constraint added for no isotropic component although this constraint can be lifted for estimating the full moment tensor like mining collapses or explosion sources.
