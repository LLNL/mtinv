See the manpage for further details on what `open' is and what it can do
for you (to have a quick look at the manpage, you may issue the following
command in a shell: `nroff -man open.1 | more')

Please note that this project has absolutely no relation to NeXT!


Installation:

If you have received the binary package (open.x.y.NI.b.pkg) you can install
open with Installer.app. This procedure will install the binary (open),
several links to it (appopen, unhide, run, Edit and Emacs[1]) and manpages
for open, appopen, unhide and run.

If you have received the source package you can either use ProjectBuilder
to install open or issue the following command in a shell: `make install'
This will install the binary (open) and its manpage. To install the
above mentioned links and other manpages, you will need to build the
`installextras' target. To do so, either add a target `installextras'
in ProjectBuilder or use the following command in a shell: `make
installextras'

If you use a newer version of tcsh, you may want to include these lines
in your `.tcshrc'. These will change the behavior of the listing and
file-completion in tcsh. You will need to customize the list of hosts you
want to use together with -NXHost. (substitute 'host1 host2')

set		nexthosts= (host1 host2)
set		nextapps=`/bin/ls -1 ~/Apps /LocalApps /LocalDeveloper/Apps /NextAdmin /NextApps /NextDeveloper/Apps /NextDeveloper/Demos |& grep '\.app$' | sort -u | sed 's/\.app$//g' `
complete	appopen 'p/1/$nextapps/' 'n/-a/$nextapps/' 'n/-NXHost/$nexthosts/' 'c/-/(a o p NXHost unhide nostat wait temp)/' 'n/*/f/'
complete	unhide 'p/1/$nextapps/' 'n/-a/$nextapps/' 'n/-NXHost/$nexthosts/' 'c/-/(a o p NXHost unhide nostat wait temp)/' 'n/*/f/'
complete	run 'p/1/$nextapps/' 'n/-a/$nextapps/' 'n/-NXHost/$nexthosts/' 'c/-/(a o p NXHost unhide nostat wait temp)/' 'n/*/f/'
complete	open 'n/-a/$nextapps/' 'n/-NXHost/$nexthosts/' 'c/-/(a o p NXHost unhide nostat wait temp)/' 'n/*/f/'
